  Hi, my name is Ian and I'm an instrument scientist working in the field of far-infrared and submillimeter astronomy.
  As well as assembling and verifying astronomical instrumentation, I am also skilled in cryogenic and optical system design.
  I have worked at a number of institutes in small and large teams and at various leadership levels.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>python</mark> and <mark>optical simulations</mark>

  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          My MSc thesis was titled: "A cryogenic test facility"
        description: |
          During my MSc program, I learned to coordinate with multiple suppliers/manufacturers and develop custom thermal and mechanical simulation frameworks in order to design a large volume, 4 K, cryogen-free test facility.
          The system remains an important part of the Astronomical Instrumentation Group (AIG) infrastructure at the University of Lethbridge to this day.

          Thesis: "A novel cryogenic Fabry-Pérot interferometer for far-infrared astronomy"
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my PhD program, I learned to design motorized optomechanical systems for operation at low temperatures to build a fully cryogenic diffraction grating and Fabry-Perot interferometer.
          The interferometer operates in the far-infrared spectral range.
